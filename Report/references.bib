% Abstract: A short overview of the paper.

This paper investigates the Text-to-SQL task, which translates natural language queries (NLQ) into SQL, has broad applications: it enables non-technical users to access databases, improves customer support efficiency, and aids developers in crafting precise SQL queries. Advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in managing the complexities of natural language understanding and SQL generation. Text-to-SQL could streamline interactions on database-driven websites by replacing input fields with direct language-based querying, especially when SQL is needed for data retrieval.
