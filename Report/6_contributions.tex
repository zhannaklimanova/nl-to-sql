\section{Contributions}

The project was a collaborative effort, with Zhanna leading the project setup, literature review, and JSON design. Lucas and Charles focused on schema generation and middleware, with Lucas also assisting with the Cantus Database setup and data extraction pipeline. Data generation was divided, with Zhanna handling GPT, Charles working with Grok, and Lucas managing Claude. Evaluation metrics were discussed by all, with Charles leading the analysis. Zhanna set up the LaTeX document and started the report, with all members contributing to every section. Regular meetings ensured clear tasks, progress, and revisions, highlighting strong teamwork.
