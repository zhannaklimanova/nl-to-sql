% Discussion and conclusion: What conclusions can be drawn from your experiments? Was your
% initial hypothesis verified? What are the limitations of your work, and how could it be extended?

1. Discussing the results using the different schemas.
2. Where the snippets should be comparing different sql queries and the gold outputs.
3. here we need to discuss that the results arent that great because haven't evaluated on a lot of data and after more data gathering it would be interesting to evaluate the same data on a open source model like lamma with fine tuning. Maybe others.
4. Limitations of your work and how it could be extended.
5. Future works. 1. models generates queries that website can do but the LLM cannot do (some of our results show this and we should figure out ways to improve it) 2. model can generate queries that website cannot do but still valid if issued in database 3) programatic of generating data (correctly (API, pipelined approach), we didn't wanna risk doing it incorrectly so did it manually), 3.5. explore multiple natural lnaguage inputs (but that's not really our research question so not doing it for now) 4. actually impelmenting this on the website that people can access and use (creme de la creme)
