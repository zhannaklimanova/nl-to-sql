Approximately 475 x 340 mm. The folio appears complete apart from any marginal trimming and segments lost to damage. It is without foliation. Black square notation is written on seven red five-line staves. Small portions of two other fragments beneath this main pastedown can be seen where some parchment has been lost from the margins.,Vigilia Nat. Domini,"<p>The fragment is firmly attached to the inside of the front cover of the sixteenth-century <i>cantoral</i> AUS-Sfl Add.Ms. 327 so that it is possible only to view the exposed side. It is oriented as if intended to be read, not placed upside down or on its side. The notated content and rubrics on the visible page are complete, although there is some loss of parchment from the margins and marked darkening and discoloration of the parchment. Any page ruling that may once have been visible can no longer be seen. This is a fragment of an antiphoner with Vespers antiphons for Vigilia Nat. Domini.</p>
<p>Remarkably, this fragment has much in common with the folios of the final half of Add.Ms. 327 from folio [41]. There are significant shared codicological and palaeographic features. Indeed, it seems possible that the pastedown and the folios now bound into Add.Ms. 327 were once part of the same book in which the fragment may have been located several folios before that which is now folio [41] of Add.Ms. 327. The chants of the pastedown are found a little earlier within Add.Ms. 327 (on folio [36]v), but in a section clearly differentiated by a range of codicological and palaeographic features.</p>
<p>On the inside front cover, two underlying fragments are visible where some parchment has been lost from the margins of the main pastedown. The two underlying fragments appear to have been pasted on the inside cover prior to placement of the main pastedown on top. That on the left side has a larger format staff in red, probably a segment of a four-line staff, while the other, showing at the top right corner, shows smaller red five-line staves with some remaining notation and text.</p>

Ff. 41r-48r: 41r, John the Baptist (Vespers, Mass); 46v, Jerome (Mass). See the description below for further detail regarding the subsequent sections of the manuscript, currently unindexed in Cantus.","The manuscript includes eight liturgical sections, beginning with what appears to be the original volume (ff. 1r-48r) and followed by an assemblage from other related manuscripts. The first section is dedicated by a devotee of Mary to a female religious house. Given the reverence for Mary stated in the dedication, it is not surprising that this first section primarily includes chants for Mary, with further feasts for John the Baptist (41r) and Jerome (46v). Examination of the contents suggests three feasts worthy of attention given the rarity of either the feast itself or the chants therein: Expectationis BVM, Presentatio Mariae, and Mariae ad Nives, each found in less than ten percent of Cantus sources. Because this first section of the manuscript reflects the original volume, this is the only section  currently indexed in Cantus (June 2018). 

Although the subsequent (unindexed) sections of the manuscript are unnumbered and comprise an unusual assortment of liturgical occasions, there is a recurring emphasis on Jerome amid various other chants: Matins Responsories for Jerome (Sept 30); Sundays 15-20 after Pentecost; Holy Week; Paula the widow (January 26); a Kyriale with four complete mass ordinary cycles; Apparition of James (May 23); and a final section for Jerome with more office chants. Of these seven sections, three bear a connection to Jerome, considering that the manuscript identifies Paula the widow as a follower of Jerome in the rubric for her feast. Among these feasts connected to Jerome, the office for Paula the widow (Vespers, Lauds, 10 chants in total) appears to be rare. There are, at the time of indexing, no other offices for her in Cantus, and only a few of the chants occur in other sources within the context of other feasts (see “Surrexerunt filii”, Can 205661, for St. Anne and “Domine dilexi decorem"", Can 2341, for the Dedication of a Church). The Mass for the Apparition of James also appears unique within Cantus sources, although this bears revisiting given that the indexing of Mass chants in Cantus is relatively recent.

A further unifying feature of the compendium is the use of two related manuscripts (seemingly by the same scribe) to begin and end the volume. Both the first Marian section and final Jerome section exhibit the same scribal hand, but the final section is clearly from a smaller volume, with smaller folio size and only six (rather than seven) systems per folio. Although the other sections of the manuscript show different degrees of scribal variance, these also imitate, in part, the original section of the manuscript, using similarly shaped, sized, and coloured letter forms to begin certain chants.","Swanson, Barbara.
