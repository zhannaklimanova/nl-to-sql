moreover, many saints' Offices in C-10 are split: after the chants for Matins, a cue indicates where the antiphons for Lauds may be found later in the manuscript.  In addition to the repeated Common of Saints in C-11 and C-10 and some other overlaps, there are numerous cross-references between the volumes.  [See the Addendum field for indications of these overlaps for chants which are not included in CAO.]  There are eleven lines on each side of Laon-Gothic notation on four-line staves with F and C clefs.  The liturgy follows the diocesan Office of Passau.</p>\n<p>Owing to their late date, C-11, C-10 and D-4 contain many Offices not surveyed in <a href=\""http://publish.uwo.ca/%7Ecantus/bibliography.html#cao\"">CAO</a>.  Some of these are edited in <i><a href=\""http://publish.uwo.ca/%7Ecantus/bibliography.html#AH\"">Analecta hymnica</a></i>:  the Holy Lance (vol. 5, pp. 35-6);
