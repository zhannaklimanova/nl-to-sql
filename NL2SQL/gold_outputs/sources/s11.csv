Chants for Good Friday (including the Lamentations of Jeremiah), Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday are followed by those for the weekdays after Easter and the ensuing Sundays in the paschal season. Offices for Ascension and Pentecost are followed by chants for Corpus Christi. A lacuna of ten folios before Corpus Christi most likely accounts for the absence of an Office for Trinity Sunday.
