The music notation is square on a four-line black staff; the f-clef is a typical German “Hufnagel” style clef, and occasionally appears alongside the c clef on the same staff. 
The music was apparently corrected or altered, possibly to give rhythmic indications: occasional isolated diamond-shaped notes appear, and in several places tails have been added, or the shape of the pes changed so that the second note is to the right of the first. 


Script is Northern Textualis Formata, sharply pointed, with well defined feet on the minims, even hairlines at the tops of minims, and some clubbed ascenders. 


Decorated with fine, elaborate curling vines in the margin, delicately shaded in a pale green-rose-blue-gold colour palette. Several identifiable bird species (magpie, woodpecker, heron) are depicted in the foliage.
A large initial red F sits inside a trompe-l’oeuil frame on a black and gold background, textured with more foliage. The colours, naturalism, and interest in texture are reminiscent of German work of the later 15th century (a dating and provenance also supported by the script); the square music notation, rather than Hufnagel,  might suggest a geographic placing to the north or west (near Belgium or the Netherlands).  Compare the similar decoration style, also with square notation, used in a fragmented German antiphoner at the Victoria and Albert:

https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O87087/manuscript-cutting-unknown/)

On the “frame” of the illuminated F, several Arabic numbers are visible; possibly this is a date (1500).

Chants for Ambrose (or another confessor) in Paschaltide, for a single martyr in Paschaltide, and for several martyrs in Paschaltide.

Square notation in black ink on five-line red staves with F clefs. 5 staves per folio side with humanistic, rounded script in the intervening spaces. 264 mm tall x 185 mm.",Contains notated readings from Matthew Chapter 26.,"<p>The parchment of this single leaf is fairly thick and stiff; the verso is the hair side. The text, which is in a rounded, humanistic script, along with the five-line staves (thought by some to be more common in Spanish regions?) suggest a dating of late-15th or 16th century.</p>
<p>The first letter ""P,"" which is red with decorative pen-flourishes in black-brown ink, is the height of two music staves. There is discoloration on the edges of the leaf and it appears as though one of the rubricated markings on the fourth line has been erased.</p>
<p>There is some transference of other writing on the recto side. It appears to be a more Gothic script with a narrow aspect and can be seen in the left margin and into the left sides of the staves in a perpendicular orientation to the principal writing-space. </p>
<p>The library record indicates that this fragmented leaf was acquired in August 1967 from the Adelphi Book Shop in Victoria, B.C. </p>
