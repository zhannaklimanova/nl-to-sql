These were likely copied between the years 1025 and 1070 (Möller, vol. 1, 32-8). Möller also suggests that these two documents could have been drafted independently of one another (ibid., 21). The original script of the antiphoner is supplemented by numerous marginal additions by later hands. These additions have been included in the index with identifiers in the &ldquo;marginalia&rdquo; field of the index (see the <a href=""http://publish.uwo.ca/%7Ecantus/fdes-w.html"">Widescreen File Description</a>). In places where these additions are illegible in the facsimile, Möller&rsquo;s transcriptions have been adopted in the index. Of particular interest are the chants for Godehard (77r, marginal), Servatius (079r, main text), the Translation of Justa (093r, marginal), the Translation of Servatius (93v, marginal), and the Passion of Laurentia (099v, marginal). Godehard was appointed bishop of Hildesheim (near Quedlinburg) by the Ottonian Henry II in the early eleventh century. The most prominent church in Quedlinburg is dedicated to Servatius, the first bishop of Tongeren, and his relics were translated to Quedlinburg from Maastricht (Servatius&rsquo;s final resting place) in the tenth century (Zender, et al., p. 25 and Map 28). The identity of Justa in this manuscript is currently unknown. Relics of a &ldquo;Jungfrau Laurentia&rdquo; were obtained by King Otto I (912-973) during his exploits in Italy and brought to Quedlinburg (Schramm and Mütherich, p. 27), but whether this is the same person has not yet been substantiated. The rubric &quot;post b&quot; is found a number of times in the added marginalia of the Quedlinburg antiphoner, always preceding an antiphon, either at the end of Lauds or at the end of Vespers. The rubric is sometimes given as &quot;post benedicam&quot; (= post Benedicamus, top margin of folio 73r) or as a variant of &quot;post b Mag&quot; (folio 104r) or &quot;p Magnif.&quot; (folio 41v). Many of the antiphons indicated by these rubrics have the character of memorials. In addition to their positition at the end of Lauds and Vespers, the texts also suggest memorials. These antiphons include Christmas chants found on the feasts of Stephen, John the Evangelist and Holy Innocents; moreover, the chant on the first Sunday of Advent, Ecce dominus veniet (cao2509), is often used in Office books to commemorate All Saints during this season of the liturgical year. In some cases, these antiphons do not suggest memorials as clearly, for example, Quam pulchra es (cao4434) on the feast of the Assumption and Domine si tu es (cao2387) on the feast of Peter&rsquo;s Chair. Both of these chants are typical of the prevailing feast. However, because of their position and how they are marked in the manuscript (in the same way as chants that seem less ambiguous), these chants have provisionally been identified as memorials. It may be that these antiphons were intended for use as memorials during the octaves of these feasts, but no clear indication is given in the manuscript.<br /><br />The index for this manuscript was drafted using Möller&rsquo;s facsimile, in which differentia formulas are very difficult to read. Accordingly when present, differentia are indicated by question marks.<br /><br />Modes for responsories are provisional; they are being proposed according to an analysis of the neume patterns found in responsory verses and the modal designations of corresponding responsories in other sources represented in the database. This analysis has demonstrated that the standard verse tones are consistently represented within these leaves by neume patterns distinctive for each mode. Because of their provisional nature, all mode numbers for responsories in the file are followed by a question mark. Where there is any ambiguity (such as in cases where a non-standard tone is given for a verse or where the verse cannot be sufficiently read), a mode has not been assigned.<br /><br />Chants not found in CAO have been assigned arbitrary numbers beginning with &ldquo;que&rdquo;.</p>","<ul><li>Möller, Hartmut. <i>Das Quedlinburger Antiphonar</i>.

Ff. 212v-216v, 277v-279v, Hymnary 
Ff. 225r-275r, Psalter","The manuscript likely originated in a Benedictine male monastery in the diocese of Würzburg before coming to the Cologne Cathedral by the fourteenth century. The inclusion of chants for St. Burchard, the first bishop of Würzburg (ff. 135v-136r), and St. Kilian (ff. 118r-120v) suggest that the manuscript was used and/or created in the diocese of Würzburg.

The predominantly red and green miniatures (ff. 82v, 83r, and 88v) were not completed at the same time or place as the text and neumation. The miniatures depict the betrayal of Christ by Judas; the teachings of Christ; and scenes from the resurrection of Christ, respectively. They were completed earlier in Liège(?) at the end of the eleventh century and inserted into the manuscript. They are thought to be from Liège owing to the similar ornamentation style in Ms. 9369-9370 in the Royal Library of Belgium, a late-eleventh century MS from the Abbey of Saint Laurent in Liège.

In the late-thirteenth century, a tonary (ff. 209v-212r) in diastematic neumes was added to the manuscript, organized by mode.
By the fourteenth century, the manuscript had moved to the Cologne Cathedral, as indicated by an annotation on f. 206r that refers to the Archbishop Wilhelm of Gennep (1349-1362): “Wilhelmus Dei gratia sancta Coloniensis ecclesiae.”

<b>Physical Description:</b> Parchment leaves. Rebound in the mid-eighteenth century with paper over cardboard. The manuscript includes eighteen ornamented text initials (e.g. 11r) and three full-page colour miniatures (ff. 82v, 83r, and 88v). In addition to the antiphoner (ff. 10v-209r), the manuscript also contains a liturgical kalendar (ff. 1r-6r) for every month except January; a tonary (209v-212r) that was added in the late-thirteenth century); a hymnary (ff. 212-216v); and a psalter, cantica, and orations (ff. 217r-279r). The leaves are numbered in a later hand in pencil in the upper right-hand corner of each recto side. The miniatures (ff. 82v, 83r, and 88v) were likely completed in the Maas region, near Liège, at the end of the eleventh century; the text and neumes date from the beginning of the twelfth century; and the tonary (ff. 209v-212r) was added in the late-thirteenth century.

Offices for Willibald, Wunnebald, and Walburga.","104v: Willibaldi, 124r: Wunnibaldi, 139r: Walburgae","The manuscript D-Trb Abt. 95, Nr. 5 (hereafter Trier 5) is a small book measuring 16.4 cm by 11.4 cm. Its 145 folios comprise three parts written in different hands. The first part is a legendary that contains saints' vitae (folios 1-103v). The second part consists of three proper offices for the Anglo-Saxon missionary siblings and Eichstätt patrons Willibald, Wunnebald, and Walburga (folios 104v-141). The change in hand and format between these sections, together with the fact that folios 104 and 141v were originally left empty, suggests that the offices were copied as nineteen bifolios, folded to create a libellus with a blank cover—a small book which could easily have been held in the cantor’s hand. Once bound with the legendary and additional pages, folios 141v- 145v were inscribed with additional hagiographic material. Written on the inside of the back cover is the sequence Magnificandus et omnicolendus for Pope Pascal II, who died in 1118. Due to this composite nature of the manuscript, estimates of its date have varied from late tenth-century to early twelfth-century.

The eleventh-century chronicler Anonymous of Herrieden (Anonymus Haserensis) attributes the offices for Willibald and Wunnebald to Reginold, Bishop of Eichstätt from 966-991, and the Walburga office to the poet-composer Wolfhard von Herrieden, author of the late ninth-century Miracula S. Walburgae. The three offices follow the secular cursus and reflect the liturgy of the Eichstätt cathedral. The texts of the Walburga office are drawn from Wolfhard’s Miracula, while those for Willibald and Wunnebald follow the vitae composed by the nun Huneberc of Heidenheim. Dörr, Schlager, and Wohnhaas suggest that Reginold composed the office for Saint Willibald for the occasion of his translation on April 22nd, 989, providing a terminus post quem for the creation of the libellus that was later incorporated into Trier 5. I have suggested that Reginold’s offices for Willibald and Wunnebald were intended as the concluding members of a trilogy: one that elevated the two brothers, whose fame was previously eclipsed by that of their celebrated sister, and claimed the legacy of this trio of saints for the diocese. The conclusion of this proper office trilogy moreover established Reginold in a poetic and compositional lineage descending from Wolfhard of Herrieden.  

The text of Trier 5 is written in Caroline miniscule. Many of the initials for the office texts were never completed. The manuscript’s adiastematic neumes use St. Gall forms, but without litterae significativae. The notational hand is characterized by long, tapered pen strokes with a prominent convex ductus. Reginold's remarkable trilingual trope Terminus et idem interminus for the last Matins responsory of the Willibald office was first described by Anonymous of Herrieden. The text linguistically retraces Willibald’s pilgrimage to Jerusalem by traveling through Latin, Greek, Hebrew and back through Greek to Latin. The trope is also transmitted independently from the office in D-Mü Clm 14377, from St. Emmeram in Regensburg. In both sources, the Greek and Hebrew portions of the text are transliterated into Latin characters. The transcription of the Hebrew portion of the trope found in the CANTUS Database is based on the transcription by Daniel et alia. The transcription of the Greek portions of the trope follows J. L. Van Dieten’s reconstruction. A complete translation of the trope into German may be found in Dörr, Schlager, and Wohnhaas.

Wolfhard of Herrieden’s office for St. Walburga is also transmitted in the fragment D-Mü Clm 29316(5 (antiphoner, Salzburg, 10th-11th century.) Selected Matins responsories from the office are recorded in CZ-Pu VI.E.4c, a twelfth-century breviary from the convent of St. George in Prague, and in NL-ZUa 6, a fifteenth-century antiphoner from the chapter church of St. Walburga in Zutphen. The Lauds antiphons of the Walburga office are transmitted in the above sources, and in the fourteenth-century antiphoner CZ-Pu XIV.B.13 from the St. George convent. Finally, the magnificat antiphon for second vespers is transmitted in the Münster printed antiphonal of 1537. Textual evidence from printed breviaries shows that a modified version of the Walburga office was in use at the Eichstätt cathedral into the seventeenth century.

Inside the back cover of the book (here indexed as folio 146) appears the addition of the un-notated sequence Magnificandus et omnicolendus for Pope Paschal II (1099-1118). My transcription adapts that of Thomas Haye for the first seventeen versicles.

Its 145 folios comprise three parts written in different hands. The first part is a legendary that contains saints' vitae (folios 1-103v). The second part consists of three proper offices for the Anglo-Saxon missionary siblings and Eichstätt patrons Willibald, Wunnebald, and Walburga (folios 104v-141). The change in hand and format between these sections, together with the fact that folios 104 and 141v were originally left empty, suggests that the offices were copied as nineteen bifolios, folded to create a libellus with a blank cover—a small book which could easily have been held in the cantor’s hand. Once bound with the legendary and additional pages, folios 141v- 145v were inscribed with additional hagiographic material. Written on the inside of the back cover is the sequence Magnificandus et omnicolendus for Pope Pascal II, who died in 1118. Due to this composite nature of the manuscript, estimates of its date have varied from late tenth-century to early twelfth-century.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh-century chronicler Anonymous of Herrieden (Anonymus Haserensis) attributes the offices for Willibald and Wunnebald to Reginold, Bishop of Eichstätt from 966-991, and the Walburga office to the poet-composer Wolfhard von Herrieden, author of the late ninth-century Miracula S. Walburgae. The three offices follow the secular cursus and reflect the liturgy of the Eichstätt cathedral. The texts of the Walburga office are drawn from Wolfhard’s Miracula, while those for Willibald and Wunnebald follow the vitae composed by the nun Huneberc of Heidenheim. Dörr, Schlager, and Wohnhaas suggest that Reginold composed the office for Saint Willibald for the occasion of his translation on April 22nd, 989, providing a terminus post quem for the creation of the libellus that was later incorporated into Trier 5. I have suggested that Reginold’s offices for Willibald and Wunnebald were intended as the concluding members of a trilogy: one that elevated the two brothers, whose fame was previously eclipsed by that of their celebrated sister, and claimed the legacy of this trio of saints for the diocese. The conclusion of this proper office trilogy moreover established Reginold in a poetic and compositional lineage descending from Wolfhard of Herrieden.  \r\n\r\nThe text of Trier 5 is written in Caroline miniscule. Many of the initials for the office texts were never completed. The manuscript’s adiastematic neumes use St. Gall forms, but without litterae significativae. The notational hand is characterized by long, tapered pen strokes with a prominent convex ductus. Reginold's remarkable trilingual trope Terminus et idem interminus for the last Matins responsory of the Willibald office was first described by Anonymous of Herrieden. The text linguistically retraces Willibald’s pilgrimage to Jerusalem by traveling through Latin, Greek, Hebrew and back through Greek to Latin. The trope is also transmitted independently from the office in D-Mü Clm 14377, from St. Emmeram in Regensburg. In both sources, the Greek and Hebrew portions of the text are transliterated into Latin characters. The transcription of the Hebrew portion of the trope found in the CANTUS Database is based on the transcription by Daniel et alia. The transcription of the Greek portions of the trope follows J. L. Van Dieten’s reconstruction. A complete translation of the trope into German may be found in Dörr, Schlager, and Wohnhaas.\r\n\r\nWolfhard of Herrieden’s office for St. Walburga is also transmitted in the fragment D-Mü Clm 29316(5 (antiphoner, Salzburg, 10th-11th century.) Selected Matins responsories from the office are recorded in CZ-Pu VI.E.4c, a twelfth-century breviary from the convent of St. George in Prague, and in NL-ZUa 6, a fifteenth-century antiphoner from the chapter church of St. Walburga in Zutphen. The Lauds antiphons of the Walburga office are transmitted in the above sources, and in the fourteenth-century antiphoner CZ-Pu XIV.B.13 from the St. George convent. Finally, the magnificat antiphon for second vespers is transmitted in the Münster printed antiphonal of 1537. Textual evidence from printed breviaries shows that a modified version of the Walburga office was in use at the Eichstätt cathedral into the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nInside the back cover of the book (here indexed as folio 146) appears the addition of the un-notated sequence Magnificandus et omnicolendus for Pope Paschal II (1099-1118).

A late thirteenth- or fourteenth-century inscription written in Middle High German which includes the phrase, \""eine Hus und eine Gartin zu Ibingen\"" (a house and a garden in Eibingen), appears to be a draft of a contract possibly involving a monastic community; notably, it references the village of Eibingen, which included a monastic community associated with Hildegard. \r\n\r\nAn earlier Latin colophon on the fragment reveals particularly striking clues regarding provenance.

Gottfried Zedler suggested in 1931, based on this inscription, that D-WI1 2 upper pastedown originally came from Kloster Johannisberg on Bischofsberg. However, Jennifer Bain has recently proposed a provenance of Georgenclause, which housed a female community originally associated with the double monastery at Johannisberg (itself governed by the St. Alban monastery in Mainz) before becoming an independent community in the early twelfth century. With the dissolution of Georgenclause in 1452, all goods were sent to Johannisberg, which subsequently closed in 1563. Given this timing, it is likely that the Riesencodex was rebound at Johannisberg sometime between 1452 and 1563.

Furthermore, although there is no evidence that the pastedowns came from either Rupertsberg or Eibingen, the preservation of Hildegard's twelfth-century chants in the Riesencodex itself at a time when such musical notation would have been considered obsolete, while using other eleventh- or twelfth-century sources as part of the binding, emphasizes yet again the singular import the magistra and her music had well after her lifetime.</p>\n"", ""safe_summary"": """"}]}, ""data"": ""a:2:{s:7:\""contact\"";i:1;s:5:\""block\"";a:1:{s:5:\""block\"";a:1:{i:17;i:1;}}}"", ""name"": ""Lucia.Denk"", ""path"": {""pathauto"": ""1""}, ""tnid"": ""0"", ""type"": ""source"", ""title"": ""Wiesbaden, Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain, 2 (Riesencodex), detached upper pastedown (fragment)"", ""status"": ""1"", ""sticky"": ""0"", ""changed"": ""1678982449"", ""comment"": ""0"", ""created"": ""1616803299"", ""picture"": ""0"", ""promote"": ""0"", ""language"": ""und"", ""ds_switch"": """", ""translate"": ""0"", ""field_date"": {""und"": [{""value"": ""11th-12th century"", ""format"": null, ""safe_value"": ""11th-12th century""}]}, ""field_rism"": {""und"": [{""tid"": ""4225""}]}, ""rdf_mapping"": {""uid"": {""type"": ""rel"", ""predicates"": [""sioc:has_creator""]}, ""body"": {""predicates"": [""content:encoded""]}, ""name"": {""predicates"": [""foaf:name""]}, ""title"": {""predicates"": [""dc:title""]}, ""changed"": {""callback"": ""date_iso8601"", ""datatype"": ""xsd:dateTime"", ""predicates"": [""dc:modified""]}, ""created"": {""callback"": ""date_iso8601"", ""datatype"": ""xsd:dateTime"", ""predicates"": [""dc:date"", ""dc:created""]}, ""rdftype"": [""sioc:Item"", ""foaf:Document""], ""comment_count"": {""datatype"": ""xsd:integer"", ""predicates"": [""sioc:num_replies""]}, ""last_activity"": {""callback"": ""date_iso8601"", ""datatype"": ""xsd:dateTime"", ""predicates"": [""sioc:last_activity_date""]}}, ""field_cursus"": {""und"": [{""tid"": ""4218""}]}, ""field_siglum"": {""und"": [{""value"": ""D-WI1 2 upper pastedown (fragment)"", ""format"": null, ""safe_value"": ""D-WI1 2 upper pastedown (fragment)""}]}, ""revision_uid"": ""613"", ""field_century"": {""und"": [{""tid"": ""3817""}, {""tid"": ""3825""}]}, ""field_dact_id"": [], ""field_editors"": {""und"": [{""uid"": ""600""}, {""uid"": ""59179""}, {""uid"": ""613""}, {""uid"": ""1258""}]}, ""field_indexer"": {""und"": [{""nid"": ""588667""}, {""nid"": ""675706""}]}, ""field_segment"": {""und"": [{""tid"": ""4063""}]}, ""field_summary"": {""und"": [{""value"": ""Bifolium used in the fifteenth- or sixteenth-century binding of the Riesencodex, which contains almost all of Hildegard of Bingen’s writings and musical compositions.
